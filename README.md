# Calculator example

## Run Simulator on Windows: 
Tested with Hexagon SDK version 5.2.0.0

Assuming Hexagon SDK is installed at `C:\Qualcomm\Hexagon_SDK\5.2.0.0`:

```bash
C:\Qualcomm\Hexagon_SDK\5.2.0.0\setup_sdk_env.cmd

make hexagon BUILD=Debug DSP_ARCH=v68

C:\Qualcomm\Hexagon_SDK\5.2.0.0\tools\HEXAGON_Tools\8.6.05\Tools\bin\hexagon-sim.exe -mv68 --simulated_returnval --usefs hexagon_Debug_toolv86_v68 --pmu_statsfile hexagon_Debug_toolv86_v68/pmu_stats.txt hexagon_Debug_toolv86_v68/calculator_q --
```

Please note that in this document we are discussing procedures for Android targets only. For LE targets refer [OS support CPU](../../software/os/os_support_cpu.md).

The calculator example consumes an array of integers and returns both the sum and the maximum value of that array.

## Using command line

### Building

The example comes with a walkthrough script called `calculator_walkthrough.py`.  Please review the generic [setup](../README.md#setup) and [walkthrough_scripts](../README.md#walkthrough-scripts) instructions to learn more about setting up your device and using walkthrough scripts. Walkthrough script automates building, running and signing the device steps mentioned in this section. You can run walkthrough script if you are stuck at any step in this section and examine the output of script and/or script itself for better understanding.

Without the walkthrough script, you will need to build both the Android and Hexagon modules.  This is accomplished by running the following make commands (assuming your desired Hexagon architecture version is v65):

    make android BUILD=Debug
    make hexagon BUILD=Debug DSP_ARCH=v65

For more information on the build syntax, please refer to the [building reference instructions](../../tools/build.md).

Alternatively, you can build the same Android and Hexagon modules with CMake.

        build_cmake hexagon BUILD=Debug
        build_cmake android BUILD=Debug

To target a different DSP architecture than the default one (V65), simply use the `DSP_ARCH` option when using the `hexagon` target. For more information on CMake usage, see the [CMake documentation](../../tools/build.md#using-cmake-build-system).

### Simulator testing

Now that we have built the code, we will discuss how to run the code on the simulator.

The Hexagon Simulator, `hexagon-sim`, is found in `%DEFAULT_HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT% \Tools\bin\`. For reference documentation on the Hexagon simulator, please refer to [hexagon simulator](../../pdf/80-N2040-1784_E_Hexagon_Simulator_User_Guide.pdf) document.  For general instructions on the process of running code on the simulator and on device, please refer to the [run](../../tools/run.md) instructions.

The following command will build the Debug Hexagon variant of the calculator example targeting the v65 instruction set:

    make hexagon BUILD=Debug DSP_ARCH=v65

This command will result in creating a binary ELF `calculator_q`. The simulator command generated by the build system to run `calculator_q` can be found in the the last section `Command line used to invoke simulator` of the generated file `hexagon_Debug_MKDOCS_HEX_TOOLS_VARIANT_v65\pmu_stats.txt`. You can reuse this command directly and/or modify it as desired for running additional simulations.

The main simulator command line options are as follows:

| Simulator option | Description |
|--|--|
|`--mv*`|Simulate for a particular architecture version of Hexagon. E.g. `-mv65`.|
|`--simulated_returnval`|Cause the simulator to return a value to its caller indicating the final execution status of the target application.|
|`--usefs <path>`|Cause the simulator to search for required files in the directory with the specified path.|
|`--pmu_statsfile <filename>`|Generate a PMU statistics file with the specified name. See the [SysMon Profiler](../../tools/sysmon_profiler.md) for more information about PMU events.|
|`--help`| Print available simulator options. |

As an example, here is how the `calculator_q` ELF file might be run on the simulator:

    $DEFAULT_HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT/Tools/bin/hexagon-sim -mv65 --simulated_returnval --usefs hexagon_Debug_MKDOCS_HEX_TOOLS_VARIANT_v65 --pmu_statsfile hexagon_Debug_MKDOCS_HEX_TOOLS_VARIANT_v65/pmu_stats.txt hexagon_Debug_MKDOCS_HEX_TOOLS_VARIANT_v65/calculator_q --

This command should generate the following output, which highlights that two tests were executed and completed successfully.

```
hexagon-sim INFO: The rev_id used in the simulation is 0x00004065 (v65a_512)

### On-target testing

Now that we have run the code on the simulator, let's discuss the process of running the code on target.

If you want to run your code on target without using the walkthrough script, please use the following steps:

* Use ADB as root and remount system read/write

        adb root
        adb wait-for-device
        adb remount

* Push the HLOS side calculator test executable and supporting calculator stub library onto the device's file system

        adb shell mkdir -p /vendor/bin/
        adb push android_Debug_aarch64/ship/calculator /vendor/bin/
        adb shell chmod 777 /vendor/bin/calculator
        adb push android_Debug_aarch64/ship/libcalculator.so /vendor/lib64/

* Push the Hexagon Shared Object to the device's file system


        adb shell mkdir -p /vendor/lib/rfsa/dsp/sdk
        adb push hexagon_Debug_MKDOCS_HEX_TOOLS_VARIANT_v65/ship/libcalculator_skel.so /vendor/lib/rfsa/dsp/sdk/


* Generate and push a device-specific test signature based on the device's serial number.

    Follow the steps listed in the [Use signer.py](../../tools/sign.md#use-signerpy) section of the signing documentation.

    Note: This step only needs to be done once as the same test signature will enable loading any module.

* Redirect DSP FARF messages to ADB logcat by creating a farf file. For more information on logcat please refer to the logcat section of [messaging](../../tools/messaging.md#logcat).

        adb shell echo "0x1f > /vendor/lib/rfsa/dsp/sdk/calculator.farf"

* Launch a new CLI shell to view the DSP's diagnostic messages via logcat

    Open a new shell or command window and type:

        adb logcat -s adsprpc

    NOTE:  This adsprpc filter captures messages from any of the DSPs (e.g aDSP, cDSP, or sDSP).

* Execute the example

    Please note that following two environment variables are to be passed along with example binary and its arguments

    - LD_LIBRARY_PATH :  Location of HLOS-side stub library on device.
    - ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH (or DSP_LIBRARY_PATH for SM8250 and later devices): Location of DSP libraries and [TestSig](../../tools/sign.md#test-signature) on device.

    For example:


        # run example with 1000 array size on CPU
        adb shell "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib64/ DSP_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib/rfsa/dsp/sdk; /vendor/bin//calculator -r 1 -n 1000"

            Allocate 4000 bytes from ION heap
            Creating sequence of numbers from 0 to 999
            Compute sum locally
            ===============     DSP: local sum result 499500 ===============
            Find max locally
            ===============     DSP: local max result 999 ===============
            Success




        # run example with 1000 array size on aDSP
        adb shell "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib64/ DSP_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib/rfsa/dsp/sdk; /vendor/bin//calculator -r 0 -d 0 -n 1000 -U 0"

            Starting calculator test
            Attempting to run on signed PD on domain 0

            Allocate 4000 bytes from ION heap
            Creating sequence of numbers from 0 to 999
            Compute sum on domain 0

            Call calculator_sum on the DSP
            Sum = 499500

            Call calculator_max on the DSP
            Max value = 999
            Success




        # run example with 1000 array size on sDSP
        adb shell "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib64/ DSP_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib/rfsa/dsp/sdk; /vendor/bin//calculator -r 0 -d 2 -n 1000 -U 0"

            Starting calculator test
            Attempting to run on signed PD on domain 2

            Allocate 4000 bytes from ION heap
            Creating sequence of numbers from 0 to 999
            Compute sum on domain 2

            Call calculator_sum on the DSP
            Sum = 499500

            Call calculator_max on the DSP
            Max value = 999
            Success




        # run example with 1000 array size on cDSP
        adb shell "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib64/ DSP_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib/rfsa/dsp/sdk; /vendor/bin//calculator -r 0 -d 3 -n 1000 -U 0"

            Starting calculator test
            Attempting to run on signed PD on domain 3

            Allocate 4000 bytes from ION heap
            Creating sequence of numbers from 0 to 999
            Compute sum on domain 3

            Call calculator_sum on the DSP
            Sum = 499500

            Call calculator_max on the DSP
            Max value = 999
            Success



        # run example with 1000 array size on cDSP Unsigned PD
        adb shell "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib64/ DSP_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor//lib/rfsa/dsp/sdk; /vendor/bin//calculator -r 0 -d 3 -n 1000 -U 1"

            Starting calculator test
            Attempting to run on unsigned PD on domain 3

            Allocate 4000 bytes from ION heap
            Creating sequence of numbers from 0 to 999
            Compute sum on domain 3

            Call calculator_sum on the DSP
            Sum = 499500

            Call calculator_max on the DSP
            Max value = 999
            Success

    *** NOTE: *** With the exception of last command, the commands above will run successfully only on a signed device. The last command executes the example using an [unsigned PD](../../software/ipc/rpc.md#signed-and-unsigned-pds), and as such, will work properly even if the [TestSig](../../tools/sign.md#test-signature) is removed from the [DSP search path](../../software/ipc/rpc.md#remote-file-system).

## Using the IDE

The previous sections described how to build and run the code on simulator or on target using the command line.
This section explains how to perform the same steps using the IDE. Before following these instructions, please ensure that you have already created a [workspace](../../tools/ide.md#start-the-ide) for your IDE.

### Importing project

Once in the IDE, import calculator into your IDE workspace by right-clicking in Project Explorer and selecting `Import -> Hexagon C/C++ -> Import Hexagon Project > Next`.

![svg](../../images/import_Hexagon_project.png)

In the dialog box, specify the following project properties:

- **Project type** – `Makefile Project`
- **Project name** – `calculator`
- **Project location** – `%HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT%\examples\calculator `

Click on the `Finish` button to finish importing the project

![](../../images/calculator_import.png)

### Building

To build the imported project, right-click on the project , select `properties` and then `C/C++ Build` . Under `Builder Settings`, enter the build command as `make hexagon BUILD=Debug DSP_ARCH=v65 VERBOSE=1` (or enter your target-appropriate build flavor).

While debugging, Debug build flavors are recommended when possible over ReleaseG. When ReleaseG is selected, the compiler will apply optimizations that will result in the disassembly interleaving various C instructions, which makes the code harder to understand while stepping through it.

Click on `Apply and Close` to apply setting and close the window.

![](../../images/calculator_build_settings.png)

Build the project by right-clicking on the project and select `Build Project`.

![](../../images/calculator_build_project.png)

Once building is done, you should see 0 errors, 0 warnings in the console window.

![](../../images/calculator_build_result.png)

### Simulator testing

To run the project on simulator, right-click on the project in Project Explorer and choose `Run As -> Run Configuration`.

This command displays the `Run Configurations` dialog box, which enables you to configure the simulator, program arguments, and runtime environment.

In order to debug on the simulator, the user must select the target-specific QuRT image `runelf.pbn` file for the desired architecture version by specifying the QuRT image path in the `C/C++ Application` field.  This approach is illustrated below and will result in the debugger loading the user ELF, calculator_q, and calling `main()`.

![](../../images/calculator_ide_runelf.png)

The dialog box displays tabs for configuring the simulator, program arguments, and runtime environment.

(Note that the left-side pane in the dialog box includes a newly-created runtime configuration named `calculator Default`, which appears under the item `Hexagon C/C++ Application`.)

To specify the simulator arguments, click on the `Simulator` tab in the dialog box. For this example please give following options in the miscellaneous flags section. The brief explanations of these flags is given [above](#simulator-testing).

```
 -mv65 --simulated_returnval --usefs hexagon_Debug_MKDOCS_HEX_TOOLS_VARIANT_v65 --pmu_statsfile hexagon_Debug_MKDOCS_HEX_TOOLS_VARIANT_v65/pmu_stats.txt hexagon_Debug_MKDOCS_HEX_TOOLS_VARIANT_v65/calculator_q --
```

![](../../images/calculator_ide_sim_arguments.png)

To execute the program, click on the `Run` button at the bottom of the dialog box.

The dialog box closes and the following output is displayed in the console of the main IDE window.

![](../../images/calculator_ide_sim_run.png)

## Modifying the example

### Project structure

Now that you are able to build and run the code, let's understand how the code is organized.

The Hexagon SDK's calculator example demonstrates the ability to offload computation on the DSP by calling a function on the HLOS and have it executed on the DSP. This is done via [FastRPC](../../software/ipc/rpc.md) in which the complexity of the remote procedure call is made transparent to the caller by only requiring the client to call a library function on the HLOS. That library on the HLOS is referred to as a stub and its corresponding implementation on the DSP is referred to as a skel.

* `Makefile`

    Root makefile that invokes variant-specific `.min` files to either build the application processor source code or the Hexagon DSP source code.

  * `hexagon.min`, `android.min`, `UbuntuARM.min`

    Contains the make.d directives used to build the application processor and Hexagon DSP source code.

* `inc/calculator.idl`

    [IDL interface](../../reference/idl.md) that defines the calculator API.

    This IDL is compiled by the [QAIC IDL compiler](../../reference/idl.md) into the following files:

    * `calculator.h`: C/C++ header file
    * `calculator_stub.c`: Stub source that needs to be built for the HLOS (Android, Embedded Linux etc...)
    * `calculator_skel.c`: Skel source that needs to be built for the Hexagon DSP

* `src/calculator_main.c`

    Source for the Android executable that calls the calculator stub on the HLOS side to offload the compute task onto the DSP.

* `src/calculator_test.c`

    Source for the HLOS-side test function.

* `src/calculator_imp.c`

    Source for the Hexagon-side implementation of the calculator interface and is compiled into a shared object.

* `src/calculator_test_main.c`
